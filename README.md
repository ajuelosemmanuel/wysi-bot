# DISCLAIMER : ⚠️ THE BOT IS NOT RUNNING ANYMORE ⚠️

It has been around a year since Discord requires message intent for this kind of bots to run. The thing is, Discord doesn't want to give it for this bot, so I don't run it now. I can still update the repository if needed, but I don't feel like this is worthy of my time as Discord will not help me in any way.

The best thing I could possibly do is to integrate the functionnality in another bot, but I don't think another `>rs` type discord bot would be relevant.

reacts when he sees the funny numeral - the only command is .roll n, n being an integer (base value is 1000).
