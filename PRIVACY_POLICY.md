# Privacy Policy

The use of this application ("wysiBot") in a server requires the treatment of some specific user data ("Data"). The Data collected is limited only to Discord messages. Use of the wysiBot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy. 

## Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to wysiBot in order to work properly. Data is not sold, stored, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement. You can view the data upon request from `Emmanuel#9864`.

## Storage of Data

The Data isn't stored. It is only processed so the bot can work (and detect "727" in your messages!). The code running is available in this GitHub repository as a "proof".

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to stop the processing of your messages by wysiBot. You may submit a request to the owner (`Emmanuel#9864`).

## Underage Users

The use of the wysiBot is not permitted for minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent for their country. This is in compliance with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). No information will be knowingly processed from an underage user.

## Questions
